Responsive HTML RSS Parser (Also for Hybrid mobile apps)

Its called HTML RSS Parser. Where the RSS links of your blogs are included in js/rss.js file and it will parse all the posts of that link in the selected tab.

This code is basically for people who want to make an android app of their blog but cannot afford to heir a android developer and cannot develop an app themselves.
